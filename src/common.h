/* Standard Ethernet + IPv4 + UDP frame, no custom protocol fields except an
 * OPTIONAL 8-byte big-endian sequence number as the first 8 bytes of the
 * UDP payload (with_seq, below) - real production traffic chrontabulator
 * captures generally won't have this (it's an artifact of this app's own
 * loopback testing, not something a real embedded device sends), so it
 * must be possible to build/parse frames without it: with_seq exists
 * precisely so "UDP payload size" in any UI built on this means exactly
 * that, with no hidden extra bytes, when disabled.
 *
 *   [0:6)     dst MAC
 *   [6:12)    src MAC
 *   [12:14)   ethertype = 0x0800 (IPv4)
 *   [14]      version/IHL = 0x45 (IPv4, 20-byte header, no options)
 *   [15]      DSCP/ECN = 0
 *   [16:18)   total length (IP header + UDP header + UDP payload)
 *   [18:20)   identification = 0
 *   [20:22)   flags/fragment offset = 0
 *   [22]      TTL = 64
 *   [23]      protocol = 17 (UDP)
 *   [24:26)   IPv4 header checksum (computed)
 *   [26:30)   src IP
 *   [30:34)   dst IP
 *   [34:36)   UDP src port
 *   [36:38)   UDP dst port
 *   [38:40)   UDP length (UDP header + UDP payload)
 *   [40:42)   UDP checksum (computed) - a real checksum, not the RFC 768
 *             "0 = not computed" shortcut, since real NIC RX hardware has
 *             been observed silently dropping zero-checksum UDP frames
 *   [42:50)   seq (8 bytes, big-endian) - ONLY present if with_seq
 *   [42:...)  or [50:...) - payload, then zero-padded to the packet's
 *             total on-wire length
 *
 * There's no built-in way to tell this traffic apart from anything else
 * on the wire the way a custom EtherType + magic number could - the
 * receiver is expected to filter by UDP destination port and/or exact
 * frame size instead (see receiver's --port/--pkt-size), and to already
 * know out of band whether the sender it's talking to has with_seq on.
